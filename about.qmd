Whether its making a simple site map or running deep learning analyses on satellite data, students and researchers are often called upon to conduct geospatial analysis. `r emo::ji("world_map")`

Fortunately, there a wealth of freely available tools can help to complete these tasks: think R, Python and QGIS.`r emo::ji("hammer")`

Unfortunately, a steep learning curve is often required to apply these tools, particularly when we don't all have a strong background in coding, GIS or remote sensing.

The UQ Geospatial Analysis Community of Practice (sometimes UQGAC, sometimes UQGEO) tries to make this process a bit less painful, by sharing our experiences, skills and tricks in a friendly and inclusive environment.

`r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` We run monthly skill sharing tutorial sessions where a member of the community teaches us something they have learned along the way.

This usually occurs on the last Thursday of each month.

See [upcoming events](/upcoming-events/) for the next session.

And check out our [blog](/index.qmd) for previous sessions.
