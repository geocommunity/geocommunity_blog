Whether its making a simple site map or running deep learning analyses on satellite data, students and researchers are often called upon to conduct geospatial analysis. 🗺️

Fortunately, there a wealth of freely available tools can help to complete these tasks: think R, Python and QGIS. 🔨

Unfortunately, a steep learning curve is often required to apply these tools, particularly when we don't all have a strong background in coding, GIS or remote sensing.

The Geospatial Community tries to make this process a bit less painful, by sharing our experiences, skills and tricks in a friendly and inclusive environment.

👩‍💻 We are based in Brisbane, Australia run monthly, online, skill-sharing tutorial sessions where a member of the community teaches us something they have learned along the way.

This usually occurs on the last Thursday of each month.

And check out our [blog](/index.qmd) for previous sessions.
