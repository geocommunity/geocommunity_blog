## Kick-starting another great year of Geospatial workshops

Hi everyone, happy 2024! (Yes, I am aware it's almost March already ðŸ˜¬).

We've had a slow start getting organised with workshops this year, but we're going to kick things off with **drop-in session in two weeks time (Thursday, March 7th, 2-4pm AEST)**. We'll send a calendar invite with teams link by email.

Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kwc3T2l2UcM-EnHWsz8kuakGVZ704ZVnmdXglgb2rhk/edit) to let us know if there is anything specific you could use help on, and we'll try to find someone with expertise to join the session.

## Upcoming workshops

We're lining up speakers for April and May on some exciting topics, more details to be announced soon.

Be sure to let us know if you have any **'hero's'** in the field that you would like to have give a workshop or seminar to the group, and we'll do our best to line it up.

We'll also be reaching out to individuals who mentioned they would like to speak to the group when they joined they joined the listserv, but feel free to **reach out to us directly if you'd like to share some of your expertise**. Workshops that come from within the community are always great!

See you soon at the next event!
