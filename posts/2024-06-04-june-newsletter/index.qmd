## Workshop Thursday June 13th (2-4pm) AEST: Intro to {terra} in R with Jason Flower

**What**: Intro to {terra} - working with raster data in R

**Who**: [Jason Flower](https://github.com/jflowernet), Project Researcher at the Environmental Market Solutions Lab (emLab) at the University of California, Santa Barbara

**When**: June 13th, 2-4pm

**Where**: Hybrid on Teams (link to join [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_OThkNDQwZTQtMmQ2Mi00ZTQ1LWE0ZTItMTVhNzI2NjVhMmJj%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%225a7cc8ab-a4dc-4f9b-bf60-66714049ad62%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22408eea62-4930-4adb-b5a1-d8f1bba01715%22%7d)) and in person at QUT Gardens Point R301

**Description**: Rasters are commonly used to represent spatial data such as elevation and temperature. This workshop will give a gentle introduction to using the R package {terra} to manipulate and plot raster data. No prior knowledge of spatial data is needed, but basic familiarity with R is assumed. For those migrating from {terra}'s predecessor package {raster}, I will describe some of the changes to functions.

**Prerequisites**

You will need the `terra` package installed, which can be done by running `install.packages("terra")`. If you have problems, there are more details about installing it [here](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html). I will also show how to make an interactive map with `terra`, which requires the `leaflet` package to be installed; `install.packages("leaflet")`. 

You will also need to have the data within this repository. You can do one of the following depending on how comfortable you are with Github:

- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/jflowernet/intro-terra/fork). This will create your own copy of this repository which has all the data and code. More details on how to fork [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
- Download the data to somewhere on your computer that you will be able to access during the workshop. The data are in a zip file [here](https://github.com/jflowernet/intro-terra/raw/main/data/data.zip). Once you have downloaded the data, unzip it, and make sure you know the path to the folder with all the data, e.g. "Documents/workshop_data/", so you can load the data during the workshop.
