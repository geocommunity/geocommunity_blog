## **Petition** to increase Australian PhD Stipends

Please consider signing this [e-petition](https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN5085) to increase PhD stipends to minimum wage. Petition reason from the online petition is copied below.

Petition Reason

PhD students contribute enormously to Australia's research every year, with their time accounting for 56% the total research output. They are the future professors and industry professionals of this country, responsible for driving innovation and ensuring strong international collaborations and competition. Their contribution is often rewarded with a stipend intended to cover the cost of living, with a minimum rate set by the Australian government. Currently, this scholarship rate is \$29,863 per year for PhD students to live on while usually working more than 40 hrs per week on their research. Not only is this below minimum wage, but it is even forcing students to live below the poverty line. With this treatment, students are incentivised to accept positions abroad, reject higher degrees by research, or quit midway through their degree due to financial distress. Australia is actively discouraging higher education and slowing its economic growth and productivity by underpaying PhD students. We believe the government should support higher education and ensure a competitive standing for Australia. The way to do this is by setting a fair, liveable rate for PhD scholarships, which is at least equivalent to the minimum wage.

### Next workshop -- Interactive Map with Python + Folium

#### Thursday May 18th, 3-5pm

![](folium-map.png)

[Dr Tony Howes](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/chemeng.uq.edu.au/profile/2223/tony-howes__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!Gl1LA-5_dhmY-PZPZSFZMQVxtKwR_Q7CYu5dRjyPolIO2s3iq5LpB8R0X7EU8bn05szg66MaPBPfai00b6iGlTDKRGYG$) (UQ, School of Chemical Engineering) will be sharing how Python and Folium (a wrapper for Python of the JavaScript Leaflet library) work together to create an interactive map. The data will be from the Brisbane Dawn Nav, May 5th MapRun. Workshop materials will be in a Jupyter notebook and downloading [Anaconda](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.anaconda.com/__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!Gl1LA-5_dhmY-PZPZSFZMQVxtKwR_Q7CYu5dRjyPolIO2s3iq5LpB8R0X7EU8bn05szg66MaPBPfai00b6iGleFX1Am_$) is recommended if you wish to follow along.

### Previous workshop

In April, Dr Jacinta Holloway-Brown presented a very informative and interesting workshop that outlined her use of Stochastic spatial random forest SS-RF methods for filling missing data in satellite images due to clouds, and also went over using raster2data for working with spatial image files (such as rasters), and converting these to dataframes in R in order to perform statistical analyses. Expect the blog post and recording associated with this workshop to be available shortly.

## Geospatial Community Updates

### First Thursday help sessions

If you have a geospatial problem (or are good at answering them), we will be trialling help sessions on the first Thursday of each month. We will do our best to have people from a variety of backgrounds answer questions and will circulate a Teams link over email.

### Website changes

You will have noticed some major changes to the [website](https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/), which now includes an easy way to join the group, and a calendar so everyone can quickly see when the next workshop will be. A massive thanks to Nick Wiggins for all the work in getting this together.
