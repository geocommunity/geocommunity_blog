## Geospatial Community August Newsletter

### Next workshop -- Spatial High Performance Computing (HPC) August 24th, 2023; 2-4pm AEST

This month Dr Nevenka (a.k.a. Nena) Bulovic will demonstrate how to run your code on a **High Performance Computer (HPC)** and provides tips and best practices. She is a [research fellow](https://smi.uq.edu.au/profile/787/nena-bulovic) at the Sustainable Minerals Institute, University of Queensland. She is currently exploring potential climate change impacts on mine closure efforts around Australia, and determining future strategies for incorporating climate change into mine closure plans. Prior to this role as a part of her PhD, she investigated the utility of remote sensing data for rain and snow estimation across mountainous terrain. Both projects incorporate her major research interests: application and analysis of large spatial datasets to improve our understanding of hydroclimate and management of water resources

### Drop-in help sessions

Let us know if you want to meet with the group this month and get some help - fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kwc3T2l2UcM-EnHWsz8kuakGVZ704ZVnmdXglgb2rhk/edit). If there's interest in a drop-in session, we'll organise it for Thursday, August 10th, 2-4pm AEST.

### In-person meet-up for those in Brisbane

Let's meet in person and celebrate this awesome community of GIS enthusiasts! **Friday August 18th in Southbank at the River Quay Green from 4pm**. BYO food and drinks. Hope to see you there! Apologies to those not based in Brisbane.

### Previous workshop

Last month Martin Peikert from Queensland University Technology gave a great introduction to Google Earth Engine and machine learning landcover classification. Blog post and youtube recording to come.

## Geospatial News

Upcoming 2023 Pacific Geospatial Conference in Suva, Fiji from November 27 - December 1, 2023, link [here](https://pgrsc.org/pacific-gis-rs-users-confrence/).

For more than 20 years, the Pacific Islands GIS and Remote Sensing User Conference has provided a platform for: (i) GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) users from nearly all Pacific Island Countries, (ii) satellite data, software, hardware and consulting enterprises and (iii) scientists from universities and research institutions. This year's conference theme is "Improving Resilience in the Pacific Islands through GIS and Remote Sensing".
