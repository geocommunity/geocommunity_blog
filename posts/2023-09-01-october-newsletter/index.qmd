## Geospatial Community October Newsletter

### Virtual drop-in help session -- October 5th, 2-4pm AEST

Let us know ahead of time if you have any questions you'd like us to focus on in help-session by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kwc3T2l2UcM-EnHWsz8kuakGVZ704ZVnmdXglgb2rhk/edit).

### Next workshop, Large raster manipulation with Dr Caitie Kuempel -- October 31th, 2-4pm AEST

[Dr Caitie Kuempel](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/37253-caitie-kuempel) from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/) will lead a workshop on large spatial data manipulation in R with {gdalUtils}. Read more from Caitie about the workshop below:

Do you work with large spatial data sets? Have you spent hours waiting for data to reproject using packages like raster and terra? There may be a faster solution using the gdalUtils package. This package provides R wrappers for the Geospatial Data Abstraction (GDAL) Utilities, which is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. It uses command line syntax, making it a bit of a black box compared to other R packages, but can save you heaps of processing time. I don't claim to be an expert -- but I'll introduce a function that I have found to be particularly useful: gdalwarp. I'll walk through the syntax and how to use the gdalwarp function for reprojecting and transforming large data more efficiently. We will also have a group discussion on potentially useful packages and workflows for large spatial data manipulation.

### Previous workshop

Zhao Xiang from Queensland University of Technology gave a stimulating presentation on building spatial models and dealing with spatial autocorrelation. Thank-you Zhao! The recording will be made available on our youtube channel.

### New blog post on inset mapping with {tmap} by Dr Jackson Stockbridge
