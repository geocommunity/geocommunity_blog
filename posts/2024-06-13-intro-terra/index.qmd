# Intro to the Terra package of R: visualising and manipulating raster data with Jason Flower

We are very lucky to have **[Jason Flower](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/about/our-team/jason-flower)** taking us through working with rasters using the {terra} package for our June workshop. He also does a good job at explaining some of the differences (functions, etc.) between {terra} and the previous {raster} R package, the precursor.

Access the data and code in the [GitHub repository](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/about/our-team/jason-flower) to follow along with the below materials.

The original post on Jason's website is [here](https://jflowernet.github.io/intro-terra/).
