## Geospatial Community July Newsletter

### Next workshop -- July 25th, 3-5pm AEST

We have an exciting workshop coming up this month; Martin Peikert from Queensland University of Technology will provide an introduction to **Google Earth Engine**, how it works, how to set it up and get started, where to get data, and finally he'll take us through a case study in machine learning land-cover classification.

### Previous workshop

Last month [Dr CÃ©sar Herrara Acosta](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/30877-c%C3%A9sar-herrera-acosta) (Griffith University) provided an excellent tour of **geospatial analysis and computer vision in Python**. Check-out his Jupyter Notebooks to try it for yourself, a top-of-the-line learning resource for those starting out in Python: [link here](https://github.com/CexyNature/geospatial-community-demo).

### Other news

#### Networking

Don't miss out, registration is still open for the [TERN Science Symposium](https://www.tern.org.au/science-symposium-2023/) in Brisbane, July 26th-27th.

#### Geospatial in-person get together

We're planning an in-person get together for the Geospatial Community in Southbank, Brisbane this August - dates etc. still to be decided.
