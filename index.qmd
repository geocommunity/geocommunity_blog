## Upcoming Workshop {style="padding-top: 5px;"}

### Large Spatial Data Manipulation in R!

#### October 31st, 2-4pm AEST on Teams

[Dr Caitie Kuempel](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/37253-caitie-kuempel) from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/) will lead a workshop on large spatial data manipulation in R with {gdalUtils}. Read more from Caitie about the workshop below:

Do you work with large spatial data sets? Have you spent hours waiting for data to reproject using packages like raster and terra? There may be a faster solution using the gdalUtils package. This package provides R wrappers for the Geospatial Data Abstraction (GDAL) Utilities, which is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats. It uses command line syntax, making it a bit of a black box compared to other R packages, but can save you heaps of processing time. I don't claim to be an expert -- but I'll introduce a function that I have found to be particularly useful: gdalwarp. I'll walk through the syntax and how to use the gdalwarp function for reprojecting and transforming large data more efficiently. We will also have a group discussion on potentially useful packages and workflows for large spatial data manipulation.
