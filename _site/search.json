    "text": "Git - what is it?\nA version control software (think track changes) useful for collaborating on and sharing code.\nGit is the software itself that records changes to a set of files locally. There are several hosting platforms that are like online repositories (think Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) that work with Git: Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub to name a few.\nThese platforms not only allow for version control but also to collaborate, organize, and back up projects.\nIn this case, we will be using GitHub to access the website files, make some changes (i.e., add a post), and then incorporate those changes back to the website repository on GitHub which will automatically update the website itself. 🙌\nWe will focus on contributing a post to an existing website repository on GitHub, but there are lots of fabulous and free resources online that go more into depth on Git:\n\nIf you need to be convinced to use Git for version control see this article and Happy Git and GitHub for the useR to git started both by Git/R guru Jenny Bryan.\nSee Caitie Kuempel’s R Ladies Brisbane presentation on getting started with GitHub in RStudio.\n\n\nGit Terminology\nRepository/repo - where a project is stored in GitHub. Think of it like a folder holding all the relevant documents that you can version control, view history, and add collaborators. The repository or repo holds all the relevant files for the website - most of which we will not touch.\nFork - A copy of another user’s repo on your account. This allows you to freely change a project without affecting the original upstream repo. You can keep your fork synced with changes in the original repo. - this is fetching upstream.\nClone - a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of a website server like GitHub. Is still connected to the remote repo online and you can push/pull edits.\nCommit - is one or more changes to a file or set of files that you are asking GitHub to keep track of.\nPush - sending your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub. Local changes updated on the GitHub website where other people can access.\nPull - incorporating and merging changes. An edit on the remote repository on GitHub can be pulled to a local repository.\nDiff - difference, or changes made that are visible as insertions/deletions for a commit.\nMain/Master - the default branch you are on. Master has recently updated to main, but they are the same thing. You are more likely to come across master on older resources. Jenny Bryan strongly urges you to create a new branch to work off of which requires using command line. For the purpose of contributing to a blogdown website, I will forgo covering this as it is unlikely more than one person will be contributing at the same time.\nOrigin - the remote repo online from which you have cloned your local copy from."

Clone the repo in a new RStudio project\n\nYou will need your GitHub credentials handy.\nYou can also set up RStudio so you do not need to input your GitHub credentials every time.\n\nFrom your forked repo, click on the green ‘Code’ button and copy the link in the pop-up window.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of finding the url to clone.\n\n\nNext, in RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project. In the pop-up window, click the last option ‘Version Control’ and then ‘Git’. In the following window, paste the url you copied from your forked GitHub repo in the first box which will automatically input the name of the project.\n\n\n\nPop-up windows of cloning a GitHub repo in RStudio\n\n\nConceptually, what we have done is:\n\n\n\nConceptual diagram of forking and cloning in GitHub Credit: Happy Git for the useR\n\n\nNow that we have cloned the repository, let’s explore the file structure a little in the ‘Files’ tab in RStudio. It is NOT a very intuitively set-up even for intermediate users of R. For the purposes of creating a new post to add to the blog, we are mostly concerned with the content/english/ directory that contains the post/ sub-directory.\nThe rest of the files are the ‘backend’ of the site using html, CSS, js, etc. to build the website. Have a look if you are curious but make changes at the risk of being ‘that person’ to break the site! But don’t worry, since we are using Git version control all changes are tracked and reversible.\nNow that we are somewhat familiar with the project structure, let’s create a new post.\n\n\n3. Create a new post\nIn our new RStudio project housing our forked and cloned GitHub repo of the website:\nUse blogdown::new_post(\"New post name\", ext = \".Rmd\") in the console to create a new post with a .Rmd extension. Alternatively, you can go to the Addins button under the menu and choose ‘New Post’ under the BLOGDOWN section and fill in the information in the pop-up window.\n\n\n\nA new blogdown post in RStudio.\n\n\n\nThis will create a new page/post bundle folder or sub-directory within post/ with the date and the name given in new_post() function. e.g., post/2021-11-18-New-post-name.\nAn index.Rmd file has been opened and only contains a YAML header (enclosed by ---). More on that later. Do not change the name of the .Rmd file.\nEach post gets its own bundle which is where your static post-specific files like images or data (.csv files etc.) used in your post should go.\nNote that the “New post name” will not only be the incorporated into the sub-directory name, but also the url to the post. Read: choose wisely and concise &gt; long descriptive name.\nThis “New post name” will automatically be filled as the ‘Title:’ in the .Rmd YAML heading. If you want a longer, descriptive title - change it in the YAML heading.\nIt is recommend you use either blogdown::new_post() or the Addin to create a new post instead of manually creating a new file (File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown script)\n\nHere, we will stick with the .Rmd extension, but know there are a few file types:\n.md - markdown, cannot run code chunks\n.Rmd - R markdown -&gt; rendered to .html using Pandoc\n.Rmarkdown - also R markdown -&gt; compiled to .markdown documents\nIf you want more of this detailed stuff see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html.\n\n\n4. Commit the changes i.e., the new post\nLet’s commit our new post. You can add something like a line of text, or not.\n\nIf you cloned the repo properly there should be a Git tab in the upper right hand window in RStudio where the Environment is. In the Git repo, there should be some files listed (i.e., post/2021-11-23-New-post-name) with different colored boxed under the ‘Status’ column - hover with the cursor to see what they mean.\nCheck the ‘Staged’ box for the files you want to include in this commit.\nClick the Commit button and a window will pop-up. In the bottom section, you will see the changes made to the file as additions (green) and deletions (red) - this is known as the diff in GitHub speak. For a new file, the whole thing will be green because it is all new.\nIn the ‘Commit message’ box, add a concise but descriptive message of the changes like ‘Added a new post bundle.’ Once you are happy with everything (file staged, commit messages, etc.) click the ‘Commit’ button.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a forked repo on GitHub.\n\n\nSome stuff will happen and as long as you do not see any obvious errors then it has probably all gone well and you’ve made your first commit!\n\n\n\nCelebrate! Credit: http://www.reactiongifs.com/cheering-minions/\n\n\nKnowing when and how often to commit is a bit of an art that comes with experience. In general, you want to commit changes that are related to a single problem and a good commit message. There is also a History button on the top left corner that will list all the commits with messages you have made and you can view the diff by clicking on a commit. All commits have a unique code which you can use to return to a previous commit etc.\nImportant notes:\n\nOnce you have served the site (see Step 6) it will create additional files within your post bundle directory. Be sure to commit all files in the post bundle created when knitting (/index.html, /index_files, etc.) not just the index.Rmd file as they will be necessary to build the site from GitHub. - You can stage them all together as one commit.\nYou will not be able to see diffs in the commit window until they have been saved.\n\nSee more on committing and best practices from the R packages book.\n\n\n\nHow committing goes… Credit: xkcd comics\n\n\n\n\n5. Push the changes to GitHub\nThe changes and commits we have made are local, but we need to get them onto the GitHub repo and then the website. This is where we need to push.\nIn the Git window, you will see a blue down arrow for pulling and a green up arrow for pushing. You will also see a message along the lines of Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by X commits under those buttons.\nFor the purposes of contributing a post to a blogdown website, we will not worry about pulls and fetching upstream. This basically means keeping your origin/master repo synced with the original upstream repo that you forked.\nIf you stick to creating a new post bundle and only modifying files within the post bundles it should be okay without fetching upstream. BUT know that if you are using GitHub to work collaboratively, staying current with the original repo is important and in general it is a good practice to always pull before you push. Recommend Happy Git and GitHub for the useR as a trusty guide.\nIf you want to try fetching upstream it is easiest to do via GitHub. Followed by a pull in RStudio.\n\nLog into your GitHub account online, and navigate to your YOU/blog_website repo.\nUnder the green Code button, there should be a Fetch upstream button that will sync your forked repo with the original upstream repo.\nThere is information about the status of your branch compared to the original upstream repo e.g., ‘up to date’ or ‘X commits ahead/behind’ to give you an idea if you need to fetch or not.\nNow in RStudio, you should be good to pull.\nRevisiting this diagram, the fetch upstream is updating your forked repo from the original yellow repo and then the pull is updating your local repo from your forked repo.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of fetching upstream and pulling Credit: modified from Happy Git for the useR\n\n\nNow we will push our commits from or local repo to our remote origin/master repo on GitHub.\nIf this is your first time using Git with RStudio, you will have to set-up a personal access token or PAT in GitHub. For detailed directions, go to the GitHub page.\n\nGo to your GitHub account online and click on your profile photo in the upper-right and go to Settings.\nIn the left sidebar, click on Developer settings then Personal Access Tokens.\nClick the Generate a new token button and give a descriptive name and expiration.\nSelect scopes or privacy settings (defaults are generally fine) and the generate the token.\nCopy your PAT and put it in the password field for any pop-ups asking for your GitHub credentials when you push.\n\nIf you see HEAD -&gt; main then all good.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of push window in RStudio.\n\n\nNow if you go back to your GitHub account and forked repo online, you should see the changes you made locally are now in the remote online repo and your commit message.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of pushed changes on forked GitHub repo.\n\n\nIn general, you should commit often and then push.\n\n\n6. Serve the site\nIn the console, run blogdown::serve_site(). Alternatively, can click on RStudio ‘Addins’ and select ‘Serve Site’. Be patient, but what happens?\n\n\n\nScreenshot of served site in RStudio.\n\n\nSome important information on what is going on from blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown:\n\nServing the site did the following: 1. Started a local Hugo server to help you preview your website, and 2. Knitted a sample .Rmd post to an .html page. You can see this from the progress message that printed to your console: Rendering content/english/post/2021-11-23-creating-a-post/index.Rmd... Done\n\nYou can also view the locally served website in a browser by clicking on the “Show in new window” button at the top left of the RStudio Viewer pane to the right of the broom.\nServing the site is using something called LiveReload:\n\nLet’s introduce an important and helpful technology that you just used: LiveReload. Serving your site uses LiveReload, which means your website will be automatically rebuilt and reloaded in your web browser when you modify any source file of your website and save it. Basically, once you launch the website in a web browser, you do not need to rebuild it explicitly anymore. All you need to do is edit the source files, such as R Markdown documents, and save them. There is no need to click any buttons or run any commands. LiveReload is implemented via blogdown::serve_site() and Hugo, and you will only need to use it once per work session.\n\nRemember, every time you save your .Rmd file will activate the LiveReload. To stop serving the site locally run blogdown::stop_server() in the console.\n\n\n7. Create your content\nOnce the website is set-up, forked, and cloned… you can get on with creating a new post with minimal coding. The main thing you will need to use is:\n\nR Markdown\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML documents that we can incorporate into the website. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. For a website post, knitting is not as important because we can serve our site locally which automatically knits anything new and view the changes as we just learned 👆.\nNow let’s add some information about R Markdown:\n\nYAML header\nThe YAML, or Yet Another Markdown Language, header at the top of the .Rmd is set between --- tags. Here is where information like the Title, Date, Author of the document go and will appear in the post.\nHave a look at previous posts and add any relevant tags or categories as you like.\nThe default .Rmd has some redundant settings (tags vs Tags) so if you use them stick with the lower case settings.\n\n\nFormatting\nCan bold and italicize text.\nHeadings:\nCan specify headings using # marks. The number of has symbols corresponds to the level of the header (2 hashs = level 2 header)\nThis will also create a structure outline of your document you can navigate either by using the ‘Formatting’ button at the bottom of the .Rmd or the right most button in the top right of the .Rmd.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of buttons to view document outline\n\n\nMake lists:\n\none\ntwo\nthree\n\nfull indent for sub-bullet\n\n\nOrdered lists:\n\nlists\nneed spaces\nbefore and after\n\nFor a return to start a new line, leave two spaces at the end of the line.\nLike this.\n\n\nIncluding code\nYou can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\nsummary(cars)\n\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n\n\nThere is also inline code: The mean of speed in the cars data set is 15.4.\n\n\nInclude mathematical notation\nMathematical notation can be enabled using third party JavaScript libraries like KaTeX. See resource of supported TeX functions. For these to render correctly you must add math: true to the YAML header at the top of the .Rmd.\nTo enter equations like a code chunk or block math, use two $ on separate lines surrounding your equations.\nPut two \\ after a line for a full return.\n\\[\ny = mx + \\beta\\\\\nE = mc^2\n\\]\n\\[ \\varphi = 1+\\frac{1} {1+\\frac{1} {1+\\frac{1} {1+\\cdots} } } \\] You can also use inline math notation by sandwiching it between $ without spaces. Like so \\(\\mu = 0.2566\\).\nAnother inline way: (= = 1.6180339887…)\n\n\nIncluding Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChunk options\nChunks are the gray areas in the .Rmd file where you can add code that will be run. These are defined by three back ticks (not a single quote, the key to the left of the 1). You can insert R code chunks but also in other languages! See the green ‘Insert’ code chunk button to see different options. An R code chunk will have the an {r  } after the opening back ticks.\nThe keyboard short cut to add an R code chunk is Ctrl + Alt + I\nYou can also set options in the {} of a chunk like hide the code chunk (echo = FALSE), suppress warnings (warnings = FALSE), and cache the chunk (cache = TRUE) if you have something that takes a while to run.\nLet’s set echo = FALSE for our plot chunk above. We are only interested in seeing the plot, not the code that produces the plot.\nYou can add a code chunk at the beginning of the .Rmd file and set global options that will apply to the whole document.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n\nSee more at:\n\nRStudio - https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\nR Markdown Cookbook - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/\n\nIt is also a good idea to name your chunks as chunks are included in the document outline. Chunks cannot have the same name - you will get an error.\n\n\nInsert objects\nYou can add pictures, weblinks, and GIFs in R Markdown. They all follow the similar hyperlink formats.\nFor a hyperlink to a website you put the word you want to hyperlink in square brackets [] followed immediately (no spaces or characters) by round parentheses (). E.g. [GitHub](www.github.com)\nTo insert an image or gif from a website you add a ! before the square brackets like so: ![description](https://media.giphy.com/media/sJWNLTclcvVmw/giphy.gif). The description in the [] will appear as a caption and the link must end in the appropriate file extension (.gif, .jpg, .png, etc) to work.\n\n\n\nFunny Yawn Credit: https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/54q75s/goodnight_tongue/\n\n\nYou can also insert pictures using the RStudio ‘Addins’ &gt; ‘Insert Image’ and uploading an image saved on your computer with a few other options like alt text. This will result in the same hyperlink code as inserting an image, but with a relative path instead of the url.\nExample use Addin to insert image\nYou can also save files (like images, html presentations) in your post bundle to link using relative paths on your own.\n\n\n\n\n7. Pull Request\nOkay, so as you were creating the content of your post you should have been committing regularly and then pushing, right?\nLet’s say we are finished with our beautiful post and read to incorporate it into the original upstream repo geocommunity/blog_website that we forked from. Remember, when we push we are pushing the commits we made locally on our computer to our YOU/blog_website repo that we forked from the original repo.\nBecause we are not owner/developers of the upstream geocommunity/blog_website repo we need to submit a pull request to submit our new blog post for approval into the upstream repo.\n\nOn your YOU/blog_website repo in your GitHub account, click on Pull requests.\nOn the right of the screen, there should be a green New pull request button. This will take to you a ‘Comparing changes’ window outlining the files and changes you have made. This will alert you to any merge conflicts with the original upstream repo. Again, sticking to creating a new post bundle/content should avoid any merge conflicts.\nClick the green Create pull request button on the right. This will take you to a ‘Open a pull request’ window that will have your last commit and space to add a larger message with your pull request or PR.\nOnce you are happy, click the green button at the end and wait for approval. You can have a bit of a conversation to hash out any issues as well over the approval process.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of GitHub open a pull request.\n\n\nCongratulations - now you have submitted your blog post to a blogdown site!\n\n\n\nCheers Credit: Sony"

WGS84 is probably the most widely used global datum, where GDA94 / 2020 are commonly used Australian datums.\nProjected coordinate reference system - here, angular coordinates have been converted to a Cartesian system, making it is easier to make maps and calculate area etc. These require a projection, a datum and a set of parameters. Projections include Mercator, UTM and Lambert.\nDefining a CRS in Terra\nTerra recommends using the EPSG database, as PROJ.4 is no longer fully supported.\nTo look up an EPSG code, go to https://epsg.org/ and find your CRS.\nWhen you know the EPSG code associated with your data, you can assign it:\n\ncrs(x) &lt;- \"EPSG:27561\" \n\nBe careful, this defines the CRS but doesn’t change the underlying data. It is not generally recommended that you project raster data because it results in a loss of precision."

    "text": "7. Raster data manipulation\nThere are a huge number of functions within Terra for data manipulation, but here are a few that might be useful. ### Extend and trim Often, we will find a lot of white space consisting of NA’s around our Raster. To remove this, we can use the trim() function. Conversely, to add white space to a raster (say, to match the extent of another Raster), we can run the extend() function.\nTo demonstrate this functionality, we will first add a lot of white space to our elevation raster using extend, before removing it with trim.\n\nextended &lt;- extend(r, 50)\ntrimmed &lt;- trim(extended)\n\n\nAggregate and Resample\nThese are used to change the resolution of a SpatRaster.\nAggregate creates a new SpatRaster with a lower resolution. Users need to provide the factor by which the raster will be reduced.\n\nagg &lt;- aggregate(r, fact = 5, fun = 'mean')\nplot(agg)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the resolution has been reduced, by a factor of five in this case.\nIn reality, we will often need to combine rasters from different sources that have different origins and resolutions; this will require us to match the resolution, the origin and the extent. For this, the resample function is the way to go. To demonstrate this, we can first change the origin of the raster we just aggregated.\n\norigin(agg) &lt;- c(10.5, 10.5)\n\nThen we can resample the original raster, r, using the new agg raster with different resolution and origin.\n\nrsm &lt;- resample(r, agg, method= 'bilinear')\n\n\n\nCrop\nCropping is one of the most widely used operations when working with Raster data. To demonstrate a simple crop, we will need to use a SpatVector: the other major data class used by Terra.\nOn the data set we have been working on, we will first use the spatSample() function, another handy tool.\nHere, we will randomly generate one point on the elevation raster.\n\nsamp &lt;- spatSample(r, 1, as.points=TRUE, na.rm=TRUE)\n\nNow we can make a buffer centered on this point using the buffer() function.\n\nbuf &lt;- buffer(samp, width = 200)\nplot(r)\nplot(samp, add=TRUE)\nplot(buf, add=TRUE)\n\n\nNow we can crop the elevation raster to the buffered area.\n\ncropped &lt;- crop(r, buf)\nplot(cropped)\n\n\n\n\nMask\nNotice that the buffer was a circle, but the cropped area is square. Why? Because the crop command uses the extent of the object which is always a rectangle. If you wanted to maintain the shape of the buffer, you will want to use mask()\n\nmask &lt;- mask(r, buf)\nmask &lt;- trim(mask) #we can trim down all the NA values using the trim function\nplot(mask)\n\n\n\n\nStretch\nAnother task is to stretch values to a given range. For example, classification can require data that is normalised to 8bit (0-255). This can be handy if you want to normalise rasters on different scales, such as elevation in m AGL and reflectance in DN.\nIn terra, this is as easy as:\n\nstr &lt;- stretch(r) #defaults to 0-255\nglobal(str, \"range\", na.rm=TRUE)\n\n     range max\ntest     0 255\n\n\n\n\nFocal\nThe focal() function can be used to clean and smooth rasters. Focal() uses a moving window with size w and a function to average neighboring cells. Lets do that with the elevation dataset:\n\nf &lt;- focal(r, w=5, fun=\"mean\")\nplot(f)"

A real world example with drone data\nIn this example, we will use some of my drone data collected from savanna woodlands in north Australia.This is a typical example where we have an orthomosaic, which was derived from a camera (RGB), and a canopy height model, which was derived from LiDAR point cloud.\nFirst, we need to reduce the size of the orthomosaic (1.3+ GB is too big). But in reality, we might want that much resolution depending on what we are trying to do.\nYou don’t need to run the below code, but this is what I did to reduce down the large orthomosaic.\n\northopath &lt;- \".../hacky_sac/2022-02-23 Basic raster analysis with R/plot1_ortho.tif\"\northo_reduced_path &lt;- \"...2022-02-23 Basic raster analysis with R/plot1_ortho_reduced.tif\"\northo &lt;- rast(orthopath)\nres(ortho) #check the resolution \n\n#now lets reduce it down with aggregate \n\n#note the filename variable lets us write directly to file\naggregate(ortho, fact = 10, fun = 'mean', filename = ortho_reduced_path)\northo_reduced &lt;- rast(ortho_reduced_path)\nres(ortho_reduced)\n\nDownload the reduced orthomosaic here\nAnd the chm here\nThe first thing to do is load the .tifs as SpatRasters in R.\n\nhomefolder &lt;- \"..../Downloads\" #where did you download the files to?\nchm_path &lt;- paste0(homefolder, \"/\", \"plot1_chm.tif\")\northo_path &lt;- paste0(homefolder, \"/\", \"plot1_ortho_reduced.tif\")\n\n#now read in the files using terra\nchm &lt;- rast(chm_path)\northo &lt;- rast(ortho_path)\n\nThis is an example of needing to merge rasters with different geometries into a single raster. Before we can do this, we need to make sure the crs, resolution, origin and extent match.\n\n#do the crs match?\ncrs(chm) == crs(ortho)\n#do the origins match?\norigin(chm) == origin(ortho)\n#do the resolutions match?\nres(chm) == res(ortho)\n#do the extents match?\next(chm) == ext(ortho)\n\nWe should see that the CRS matches, but nothing else.\nThe resample() function can match the geometries. If we wanted to keep the higher resolution of the orthomosaic, we can run:\n\nchm_resampled &lt;- resample(chm, ortho, method = \"bilinear\")\n#now, geometry should match\nres(chm_resampled) == res(ortho)\norigin(chm_resampled) == origin(ortho)\next(chm_resampled) == ext(ortho)\n\nOn the right track. lets plot them to have a look.\n\nplot(chm_resampled)\n\n\n\nplot(ortho)\n\n\nWe can see that even though they have the same extent - as enforced by the resample() - there are a lot of blank cells around the CHM.\nLets get rid of those blank (NA) cells using the trim() function.\n\nchm_resampled &lt;- trim(chm_resampled)\nplot(chm_resampled)\n\n\nThat’s better, now lets crop the orthomosaic using the CHM.\n\northo_cropped &lt;- crop(ortho, chm_resampled)\n\nNow everything should match, and we can finally combine these layers into a single SpatRaster object. For this, you can simply concatenate the layers: c(layer1, layer2, layer3).\n\ncombined &lt;- c(ortho_cropped, chm_resampled)\nplot(combined)\n\n\nThe band names don’t make a lot of sense at this point, so we can rename them using the names() function.\n\nnames(combined) &lt;- c('red', 'green', 'blue', 'chm')\n\nFinally, prior to doing some analysis, we might want to stretch the chm to 8bit - so its not under-weighted compared to the RGB data. This calls for the stretch() function.\n\ncombined$chm &lt;- stretch(combined$chm)\nplot(combined)\n\n\nNow we have a raster stack we can work with!"

In the words of the developers:\n\n“A close approximation of tidyness for relational geospatial data is two sf objects, one describing the node data and one describing the edge data.”\n\nIn other words, an sfnetwork object is made up of one sf object for nodes and one sf object for edges. (As opposed to two simple data.frames for a tidygraph object.)\n\n\n\nA visual explanation of sf objects by Allison Horst (copyright hers): a dataframe with sticky geometries in a list column. The geometries are “sticky” because they don’t vanish when, say, you select() columns.\n\n\nIn the edges component of a network, it is also possible (or necessary) to specify where the edge starts and finishes, using the from and to columns. Such information can be interpreted as the direction of the edge in a “directed” network, or simply as its two extremities in the case of an “undirected” network.\nFinally, another important characteristic of the edges is their weight. This can relate to any kind of information, but if we are interested in distances between points, it will typically be the length of the edges."

(To understand how these features are tagged in the database, a good starting point is the Map Features page on the OSM wiki.)\n\nlibrary(osmdata)\n\n\n# build the query\nwe_foot &lt;- opq(\"west end, meanjin\") %&gt;% \n  add_osm_features(features = c('\"highway\"=\"footway\"',\n                                '\"highway\"=\"steps\"',\n                                '\"foot\"=\"yes\"',\n                                '\"highway\"=\"living_street\"')) %&gt;% \n  osmdata_sf()\n\nThe osmdata package allows building Overpass queries to download OSM vector data that matches our criteria:\n\nFeatures tagged as highway=footway, including footpaths, crossings…\nFeatures tagged as highway=steps, for stairs\nFeatures tagged as foot=yes, for example bikeways on which foot traffic is allowed (see this shared bikeway for an example)\nFeatures tagged as highway=living_street, a shared road on which pedestrians often have right of way\n\nFinding the right combination of OSM tags to use is always an iterative process, refining the selection at each step.\nWe choose to return an sf object, which might contain points, lines and polygons. We are only interested in the lines:\n\nnames(we_foot)\n\n[1] \"bbox\"              \"overpass_call\"     \"meta\"             \n[4] \"osm_points\"        \"osm_lines\"         \"osm_polygons\"     \n[7] \"osm_multilines\"    \"osm_multipolygons\"\n\nwe_foot_lines &lt;- we_foot$osm_lines\n\nWe can visualise the resulting object with the sf package:\n\nlibrary(sf)\nwe_foot_lines %&gt;%\n  st_geometry() %&gt;% \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\nIt seems to have kept a ferry route, which was tagged with foot=yes and route=ferry on OSM. We can remove it:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nwe_foot_lines &lt;- we_foot_lines %&gt;% \n  filter(is.na(route))\n\nAnother caveat in our process is that some footpaths are mapped as closed ways on OSM, and are therefore returned as a polygon:\n\nwe_foot$osm_polygons %&gt;% \n  st_geometry() %&gt;% \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\nThe smaller ones are proper pedestrian areas, but the bigger ones are probably footpaths encircling a whole residential block.

This usually isn’t a problem (think speed limits, surface, lighting, width…) but can be in some cases (for example if the length of the edge had already been added). The order of processing often matters.\nAnother example is the removal of nodes that have only two edges connected, also called “smoothing of pseudo-nodes”. This would be useful to simplify a network and reduce the processing times needed. We again use a combination of convert() with the relevant spatial morpher, to_spatial_smooth():\n\nfoot_simple &lt;- convert(foot_net, to_spatial_smooth)\nplot(foot_simple)\n\n\n\n\nFor our example, simplifying the network might not be useful:\n\nIf we calculate isodistances or isochrones, reducing the number of nodes will reduce the precision;\nOnce again, one needs to take care of the potential loss of valuable data. For example, do nodes contain relevant tags, like ones describing physical barriers? And how will the combined edges’ tags be stored?\n\nMore information about “spatial morphers”, including what options exist for dealing with attributes when multiple features are merged, is available in the documentation: ?spatial_morphers\n\n\nWeights\nAs mentioned before, a common weight associated with each edge of the network is the edge’s length.

However, every new analysis of the network might reveal more interesting information about the data we have used. For example, the shortest path calculated might go through private residential paths (usually blocked by gates), and avoiding those would mean extra steps in pre-processing (for example keeping track of existing OSM tags like barrier=* on nodes and access=private on ways)."

    "section": "Question 1 - Rasterizing field size information per farm.",
    "text": "Question 1 - Rasterizing field size information per farm.\n\nThe question.\nI have a geospatial problem to crop field mapping.I am using household survey data that includes a section on crop fields, their location, their area, use, distance to homestead and other things. An example for one country, Ethiopia, is here.\nFor privacy reasons I cannot get the GPS coordinates of each crop field although this data was collected. The household GPS locations are easier to access.\nI try to think through a process of calculating field size per raster grid cell that intersects with a circle around a household that is defined by the maximum field-homestead distance. I know that all the fields have to be within that circle and I know the mean field size and the distribution of field sizes within that circle. I was thinking to just assume that every grid cell in the circle has the mean field size of that circle with an error range based on the field size distribution. But there are also overlaps between circles and I don’t just want to calculate averages in this case.\nDo you know of a similar geospatial problem that someone has solved already that I could look into to get some ideas? From another field outside agriculture even?\n\n\n\nCreate some dummy data\nIn this problem, we have point data (the households), with attributes related to the crop fields that are associated with that household, such as their area, use and distance to homestead. One of those attributes, maximum distance of field to homestead, was used to generate the buffers (red circles). But because maximum distance doesn’t perfectly capture the distance of fields to homesteads, they overlap. This complicates the process of rasterising the buffers.\nTo explore our options, we will use the Terra R package.\nFirst, we will create some dummy data.\n\nlibrary(terra)\n\nterra 1.7.18\n\nr &lt;- rast(ncols=10, nrows=10, xmin = 1, xmax = 1.1, ymin = 1, ymax = 1.1)\nvalues(r) &lt;- sample(1:ncell(r), ncell(r))\n\nThen create some random points within our dummy raster (r). These represent the household locations.\n\nsamp &lt;- spatSample(r, 25, as.points=TRUE, method = \"random\")\nwidths &lt;- sample(100:1000, length(samp), replace = T)\n\nFinally, we will add buffers to each of the points, randomly sized to represent the variability in maximum distance to field from household.\n\nbuf&lt;-list()\nfor(i in 1:length(samp)) {buf[[i]] &lt;- buffer(samp[i], widths[i])}\nfields &lt;- vect(buf)\n\nAlso, add in other attributes (dmax, dmin and dmed) representing other field attributes like mean field size etc.\n\nfields$ID &lt;- 1:25 #field IDs\nfields$dmax &lt;- expanse(fields) / 1000 #based on area covered by vector. \n\nWarning: [expanse] unknown CRS. Results can be wrong\n\nfields$dmin &lt;- fields$dmax / 4 \nfields$dmed &lt;- fields$dmax / 2 \n\nSo now when we plot everything, we have essentially recreated the problem.\n\nplot(r) #plot the dummy raster\nplot(fields, add = T)\n\n\n\n\nAnd when we look at the attributes of the fields dataset, we have attributes for each field.\n\nfields\n\n class       : SpatVector \n geometry    : polygons \n dimensions  : 25, 5  (geometries, attributes)\n extent      : 0.9961141, 1.096878, 0.9973581, 1.102877  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\n coord. ref. :  \n names       : lyr.1    ID      dmax      dmin      dmed\n type        : &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;     &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;     &lt;num&gt;\n values      :     5     1 1.071e-07 2.677e-08 5.354e-08\n                 100     2 6.054e-08 1.514e-08 3.027e-08\n                  23     3 1.221e-07 3.052e-08 6.104e-08\n\n\n\n\nMethod 1. go back to point data, and add rasterise points using the grid.\nThis ensures that polygons are not overlapping - 1 point per grid cell. but it removes the spatial representation of the radius.\n\ncentres &lt;- terra::centroids(fields)\nplot(r)\nplot(centres, add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have converted the buffers to points, we can use the rasterize function to add the point data to the rasters - one layer per attribute.\n\ndmax_cent &lt;- rasterize(centres, r, \"dmax\", \"mean\") #rasterize the dmax attribute of the points\nnames(dmax_cent) &lt;- \"dmax_cent\" #name the dmax layer\n\ndmin_cent &lt;- rasterize(centres, r, \"dmed\", \"mean\") # rasterize the median field size attribute from the points\nnames(dmin_cent) &lt;- \"dmin_cent\" #name the dmin layer\n\ndmed_cent &lt;- rasterize(centres, r, \"dmin\", \"mean\") #rasterize the min field size from the point layers\nnames(dmed_cent) &lt;- \"dmed_cent\" #name the dmed layer\n\ncent_combined &lt;- c(dmax_cent, dmin_cent, dmed_cent) #combine the rasters into a single spatVector\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\n\nplot(dmin_cent, xlim = c(1, 1.1))\nplot(centres, add=T)\n\nplot(dmax_cent)\nplot(centres, add=T)\n\nplot(dmax_cent)\nplot(centres, add=T)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that each household, represented by the points, relates to a single raster grid cell. This might be enough, but the spatial information embedded in the buffers - where the buffer size is proportional to maximum distance - is lost.\nSo what options are there to preserve this information when rasterizing?\n\n\nMethod 2. add values of buffer to grid cell, and account for the proportion of overlap.\nThere has been a similar issue posted on stackoverflow which gives us some clues.\nOk, going back to our fields and our raster:\n\nplot(r)\nplot(fields, add=T)\n\n\n\n\nOne idea was to scale the field size by the fraction of the grid cell that it covers, such that a 100m max field size, that covered 5% of a grid would become 5m. Unfortunately this doesn’t make a lot of sense, as the actual size of the field hasnt changed.\nSo really what we want to do is just add the field size onto the raster. so even if its a small fraction, the average size would still be 100m.\nBut its not so simple when field buffers overlap: what happens when a 100m field and 50m field overlap within the same grid cell?\nOne approach is to reduce the cell size of the original raster, then individually rasterize all of the field polygons using this fine resolution raster, before merging the musing the mosaic function to make the grid cells much smaller than they currently are.\n\ndis &lt;- terra::disagg(r, 20) # 20x smaller cells. \ndvalue &lt;- lapply(1:nrow(fields), \\(i) rasterize(fields[i,], dis, field = \"dmax\")) #rasterize each of the fields using the fine raster  \ndvalue &lt;- terra::sprc(dvalue) #make a spatraster collection out of the list of rasterised fields \ndvalue &lt;- mosaic(dvalue) #mosaic them all together, which by default will average overlapping cells\nplot(dvalue)\nplot(fields, add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nNow, the original question was what is the average field size per grid cell. When we re-aggregate the data\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\nplot(dmax_cent)\nplot(fields, add=T)\n\nplot(aggregate(dvalue, 20, mean, na.rm = TRUE))\nplot(fields, add=T)\n\n\n\n\nSo now, each cell should represent the average field size within it. This is not perfect: It might tell you where there are trends toward bigger or smaller fields, but the raster cell is not proportional to field size so be careful with summary statistics."

    "text": "Question 2. Take a sample of a continuous raster using a random sample of a categorical raster.\n\nThe problem\nHave 2 rasters, one categorical representing classes of coral reef cover, and one continuous representing wave action.\nWanting to take a random sample of the reef cover raster (excluding NAs), then use that sample to return corresponding values of the continuous raster. The two rasters have different resolutions.\n\n\nAttempted solution\nAs always, we will start by trying to create a dummy dataset. Starting with the reef cover raster.\n\nlibrary(terra) #load the terra library, the best for raster analysis in R \n\n#make a coral cover raster\ncoral &lt;- rast(ncol=10, nrow=10, names=\"stratum\")  # a 10x10 raster\nset.seed(1)\nvalues(coral) &lt;- round(runif(ncell(coral), 1, 5)) #values 1-5, setting 5 as NA\ncoral &lt;- terra::classify(coral, cbind(5, NA)) # #make 5 NA, so the dataset has some NA\n\n#make a wave action raster\nwave &lt;- rast(ncol=20, nrow=20) \nset.seed(1)\nvalues(wave) &lt;- runif(ncell(wave), 1, 25)\nwave &lt;- terra::classify(wave, cbind(5, NA))\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2)) #plot them side-by-side\nplot(coral)\nplot(wave)\n\n\n\n\nNow we can take a random sample of the coral cover raster using the spatSample function.\n\nrand_pts &lt;- spatSample(coral, 10, \"random\", as.points=TRUE, na.rm = TRUE) #this will sample the number from among the strata (not #NA) \nplot(coral)\nplot(rand_pts, 1, add=TRUE, plg=list(x=185, y=1, title=\"points\"))\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can see that each point relates to the stratum integer of the raster:\n\nrand_pts$stratum\n\n [1] 3 3 3 4 1 4 4 3 3 4\n\n\nAs an aside, this doesn’t seem to work when we have a named categorical raster, as opposed to a categorical raster represented by integers. As we will see if we label the categories using the levels function:\n\ncoral_named = coral-1 #values need to start at zero, not one, for the levels function. \n#the way we made the raster, they started at one. \n\nlevels(coral_named) &lt;- c(\"Rubble\", \"Coral/Algae\", \"Sand\", \"Rock\") #now we Can add our category labels in \n\nWarning: [set.cats] setting categories like this is deprecated; use a two-column\ndata.frame instead\n\nplot(coral_named)\n\n\n\n\nWe would obviously prefer our categorical raster to look like this, with names rather then integers representing the categories. But when we randomly sample it with spatSample (using the exact same code as above), we get a whole pile of NAs.\n\nrand_pts_named &lt;- spatSample(coral_named, 10, \"random\", as.points=TRUE, na.rm = TRUE) #this will sample the number from among the strata (not NA) \nrand_pts_named$stratum\n\n [1] Coral/Algae Rock        Rock        Sand        Rock        Coral/Algae\n [7] Rock        Sand        Sand        Rubble     \nLevels: Rubble Coral/Algae Sand Rock\n\n\nNot sure why this is the case and it might be a good one to put on stack overflow… but for now, lets just move on knowing the integers represent the cover classes.\nSo getting back to the task - we can use the random sample from the coral layer stored in the rand_pts spatVector using rasterize:\n\ncoral_sample &lt;- rasterize(rand_pts, wave, field = \"stratum\") #rasterize the points using the wave raster as a template\n\nAnd now that we are done sampling, we can name our coral categories.\n\ncoral_sample &lt;- coral_sample -1\nlevels(coral_sample) &lt;- c(\"Rubble\", \"Coral/Algae\", \"Sand\", \"Rock\") #now we can add our category labels in\n\nWarning: [set.cats] setting categories like this is deprecated; use a two-column\ndata.frame instead\n\n\nFinally, we can use the mask function to grab the cells where we have sample values of coral:\n\nwaves_sample &lt;- mask(wave, coral_sample) #get the waves cells where the points were \n\nLets have a look at the two rasters to see if they it all makes sense.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2)) #plot them side-by-side\nplot(coral_sample)\nplot(waves_sample)"

    "text": "Following the success of our last problem solving session, we ran another one in June.\n\n\nWe had interesting and wide-ranging discussions about the issues people are having with geospatial analysis.\nBelow are some of the key issues / contributions / suggestions that came up.\n\n\nLorna has been processing some massive raster datasets in R, and has been running into persistent RAM issues. The code below contains a few tricks of the trade to try to help get you up and running if you are running into RAM issues.\n\n\nThis includes a section about changing the RAM allocated to java - which is required for the species distribution modelling package MaxEnt.\n\n#increase RAM allocation; once increased you cannot decrease it until you restart your session\nmemory.limit(8000)\nmemory.limit(5000) #is ignored\n###check current RAM allocation\nmemory.limit()\n\n#if you restart r session it goes back to original RAM allocation\nmemory.limit()\n####\n# change RAM allocated to java (heap space)\n###\n#more niche, but java is needed to run MaxEnt (species distribution modelling)\n#settings need to be changed before opening the library\noptions(java.parameters = c(\"-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\", \"-Xmx16000m\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also increase the RAM available to specific packages - namely the raster and terra packages:\n\n###with raster package\n\n#check allocated fraction (and other raster settings, including temporary directory)\nrasterOptions()\n\n#can increase or decrease in same session\nrasterOptions(memfrac=0.9)\nrasterOptions(memfrac=0.3)\n\n#restarting session goes back to original allocation\n\nwith terra package; Mitch showed us: https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/post/2022-02-23-raster-analysis/\n\nlibrary(terra)\nterraOptions()\nterraOptions(memfrac=0.7)\n\n#and you can also change the temp directory directly for terra... but only terra\nterraOptions(memfrac=0.2, tempdir = \"R:/big_drive/Trial\")\n\n\n\n\nAs described here, you can change the temp directory so it doesn’t fill up your computer.\n\nSys.getenv() #to check all setting of the environment\n\n#check the directories now\nSys.getenv(\"TMPDIR\",\"TMP\",\"TEMP\")\n\n#each path needs to be specifically written (otherwise it doesnt work, because of the quotations) \ntochange&lt;-c(\"TMPDIR = 'R:/large_disk/RtempFiles'\",\n            \"TMP = 'R:/large_disk/RtempFiles'\",\n            \"TEMP = 'R:/large_disk/RtempFiles'\")\n#\"R:/large_disk/Trial\"\n\n#write the file as .Renviron in your associated user path (R_USER)\nwrite(tochange, sep=\"c\", file=file.path(Sys.getenv('R_USER'), '.Renviron'))\nSys.getenv('R_USER') #the path where the file was written\n\n#restart session, can be without closing R\nSys.getenv(\"TMPDIR\",\"TMP\",\"TEMP\")\n\n\n\n\nBy default, R uses only one core;but most computers these days have multiple cores\nHere is a summary.\nHere are 2 ways to do this. ###1.\n\n#specific to an operation, but cannot do many raster operations\nclusterR(x, fun, args=NULL, cl=mycluster)\n\n###2.\nThis is the easiest, because you can put anything you need in between\n\nbeginCluster()\nendCluster()\n\nAs an example:\n\n#e.g.\nParentDir&lt;-\"R:\\\\FITZBIO-A6478\\\\4_Analysis\\\\R\\\\1_HSModel\\\\2_RasterTifs\\\\F3_90m\"\nLayer1 &lt;-raster(file.path(paste0(ParentDir,\"\\\\Bio1.tif\")))\nLayer2 &lt;-raster(file.path(paste0(ParentDir,\"\\\\Bio2.tif\")))\n#plot(Layer1) \n#plot(Layer2)\n#without using multiple cores\nstart_time &lt;- Sys.time()\ns&lt;-stack(Layer1,Layer2)\nLay1xLay2&lt;-overlay(s, fun=function(x,y) x*y )\nend_time &lt;- Sys.time()\nNoCore&lt;-end_time - start_time\n\n#using multiple cores, but measuring time only of the process itself\nbeginCluster()\nstart_time &lt;- Sys.time()\ns&lt;-stack(Layer1,Layer2)\nLay1xLay2&lt;-overlay(s, fun=function(x,y) x*y )\nend_time &lt;- Sys.time()\nendCluster()\nTimeExlcudeCore&lt;-end_time - start_time\n\n#using multiple cores, measuring time of whole process (including parallelizing)\nstart_time &lt;- Sys.time()\nbeginCluster()\ns&lt;-stack(Layer1,Layer2)\nLay1xLay2&lt;-overlay(s, fun=function(x,y) x*y )\nendCluster()\nend_time &lt;- Sys.time()\nTimeIncludeCore&lt;-end_time - start_time\n\n#check time results\nNoCore\nTimeExlcudeCore\nTimeIncludeCore\n#when preparing this, sometimes I got same results sometimes I didn't\n\n\n\n\nRunning gc() gets rid of temp files, so be sure to save results needed and not do it half way through a process that relies on temp files\n\n\n\nIf all else fails, you could think about how much resolution you actually need, and whether it could be reduced.\n\n#rescale base layer; basis for the rest\nBaseLayerFX&lt;-aggregate(Layer1, fact=factor) #factor defined where paths are loaded\n\nLayer2_coarse&lt;-resample(Layer2,BaseLayerFX) #it will match the extent of the baselayer\n#if you aggregate Layer2, there might be slight differences in pixel positions/extents etc-so they may not match\n#it is best to resample using the first one as basis\n\n####\n# save layers you create in between\n###\n#so next time you don't have to re-do them... \n#it saves times for you and it frees up memory both for new processes -and garbage collection gc()\n\n#e.g.\n#writeRaster(Layer2_coarse, filename=file.path(ProcessOut,paste0(\"uchas.tif\")), format=\"GTiff\", overwrite=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nStill on the subject of memory, Tim showed us how to use the doParallel package in R, with a reproducible example.\nThis is a very basic example of what is called an embarrassingly parallel task, but should be a nice short intro for absolute beginners to parallel programming.\nParallel computing is a complex field of computer science.

    "section": "Creating a blog with quarto",
    "text": "Creating a blog with quarto\n\nWhat is quarto?\nQuarto is a “multi-language, next-generation version of R markdown from RStudio.” It is designed to be programming language (compatible with R, python, Julia, and more…?) and tool agnostic (RStudio, VSCode, jupyter, Observable). In this tutorial, we are focusing on Quarto and RStudio.\nThe basic model of Quarto publishing is taking a source document and rendering it to a variety of outputs like html, pdfs, and Word. The backend process is illustrated below. The key difference from R Markdown is that it uses pandoc. For those interested in the details, I would recommend the Welcome to Quarto! 2 hr workshop on Youtube led by Tom Mock at RStudio.\n\nFAQ for R Markdown users.\n\n\nMake a quarto blog in RStudio\nRStudio has quarto built-in with recent versions after 2022.07. Go to File &gt; New Project or the R in a blue cube under ‘Edit’ and you will see Quarto options right there!\n\nLet’s click on the Quarto Blog option. In the next window, name you project (e.g., myblog), select where to save the project with the Browse button, and ensure ‘Create a git repository’ is checked. More on git later.\n\nThe default project is populated with some example files and folders. The open index.qmd file is the ‘home page’ of the blog that will list all the posts. The .qmd is the file extension for a Quarto file just like .Rmd for R Markdown. Go ahead and change the first title field in the YAML. For instance, change ‘my blog’ to ‘My Blog’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYAML stands for ‘Yet Another Markup Language’ and is delineated by a triple dash (—) at the beginning and end of the YAML section. This is where you define settings for you quarto document/post.\n\n\nNow, let’s look at one of the template posts. In the Files pane click on posts &gt; welcome &gt; index.qmd. Here we can see a template for a ‘Welcome’ post.\nA recent addition to RStudio is that you can view the ‘Source’ (top left pane) as either the Source code or Visual editor. These views can be swapped by toggling the buttons at the top right of the pane. The Source code (blue box below) displays all the source code for your quarto file such are your R code (in chunks - none in this example) and Markdown narrative text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA code chunck is delineated by three backticks (button to the left of 1) and {} with the language for the code chunk (R, python etc.). Click the green C+ button to the left of run to add a new R chunck. Or keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I.\n\n\n\nThe Visual editor displays a rendered version of your quarto file - more like what it will look like when the site is published. This is more similar to writing in a text editor like Word. You can also see there some extra formatting buttons in the Visual Editor like bold/italics and super/subscripts. The ‘Table’ function is also a welcome edition as formatting tables in Markdown is very finicky and tedious.\nTry inserting a table or super/subscript (Format &gt; Text &gt; Strikethrough/Superscript/Subscript/Smallcaps) in the Visual editor and then toggle to the Source code. Now you can see the associated Markdown code for whatever you just did! Super handy.\nNow, open the _quarto.yml file. Here we can see the project type (a website), some website formatting (the navigation bar), and some other customization fields. Update the title field to match the title we edited earlier. In my case, it was ‘My Blog’. Feel free to edit other fields such as your GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn profile links etc. You can also change the theme to one of many built-in themes.\n\n\nDon’t forget to save your files when you make changes. If the file name in the tab is red - that means you have unsaved changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save your files when you make changes. If the file name in the tab is red - that means you have unsaved changes.\n\n\nThe Visual editor is pretty cool, but it’s not exactly the same as previewing your website before publishing. Click on the Render button at the top and see what happens.\nA preview of your blog should have popped-up in a web browser. You can navigate like you would a website to see all the features. Go to the about page - we can see it is the default page with the Quarto blog project. If you’d like, open the about.qmd page in the project directory and make a change. Add some text, delete a link (like LinkedIn) and then save your changes.\nCongrats - you’ve made a blog!\n\n\n\nCelebrate! Credit: http://www.reactiongifs.com/cheering-minions/\n\n\nIn the top right view pane of RStudio, you can see Render and Background Jobs tabs. If you’d like to get an idea of what is happening in the background, check out these tabs. In the Backgroun Jobs tab, there is a red stop sign in the top right corner to stop previewing your site.\nBut how do I share it with the world?? First, we will need to version control our project with git and store it in a remote repository."

    "text": "Git - what is it?\nA version control software (think track changes) useful for collaborating on and sharing code.\nGit is the software itself that records changes to a set of files locally. There are several hosting platforms that are like online repositories (think Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) that work with Git: Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub to name a few.\nThese platforms not only allow for version control but also to collaborate, organize, and back up projects.\n\nIn this case, we will be using GitHub to access the website files, make some changes (i.e., add a post), and then incorporate those changes back to the website repository on GitHub which will automatically update the website itself. 🙌\nThere are lots of fabulous and free resources online that go more into depth on Git:\n\nIf you need to be convinced to use Git for version control see this article and Happy Git and GitHub for the useR to git started both by Git/R guru Jenny Bryan.\nSee Caitie Kuempel’s R Ladies Brisbane presentation on getting started with GitHub in RStudio.\n\n\nGit Terminology\nRepository/repo - where a project is stored in GitHub. Think of it like a folder holding all the relevant documents that you can version control, view history, and add collaborators. The repository or repo holds all the relevant files for the website - most of which we will not touch.\nCommit - is one or more changes to a file or set of files that you are asking GitHub to keep track of.\nPush - sending your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub. Local changes updated on the GitHub website where other people can access.\nPull - incorporating and merging changes. An edit on the remote repository on GitHub can be pulled to a local repository.\nDiff - difference, or changes made that are visible as insertions/deletions for a commit.\nMain - the default branch you are on. Master has recently updated to main, but they are the same thing. You are more likely to come across master on older resources. Jenny Bryan strongly urges you to create a new branch to work off of which requires using command line. For the purpose of contributing to a quarto website, I will forgo covering this as it is unlikely more than one person will be contributing at the same time.\nOrigin - the remote repo online from which you have cloned your local copy from.\n\n\n\nHow committing goes… Credit: xkcd comics\n\n\n\n\nUsethis on our blog project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Git and GitHub for the useR is the online bible of using git with R by legendary Jenny Bryan. This book covers all the basics in details and provides workflows and troubleshooting Jenny Bryan has a whole chapters on what is covered below. Ch 7 Configure Git, Ch 9 PATs, and Ch 17.3 Create and connect a GitHub repo. It’s an excellent resource that I would highly encourage you to check out.\n\n\n\nUsethis is a workflow package designed to automate repetitive tasks for package development and project setup. Here, we’ll be using it for the latter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might need to install usethis. Check by search in the Packages window in the bottom right pane in RStudio.\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nOr you can install the development version: install.packages(\"devtools\") if you don’t have devtools. devtools::install_github(“r-lib/usethis”)\n\n\n\nConfigure Git\nIf you have never used Git before you will need to configure your account. We can do this in R with usethis using your GitHub username and email. These must be the details associated with your GitHub account. You will only need to do this once.\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"Jane Doe\", user.email = \"jane@example.org\")\nIf you are not sure if you have configured Git, you can check with running usethis::edit_git_config() in the console. This will open your .gitconfig file and you can check the [user] details. If these are not right you can go ahead and change theme in the file and save.\n\n\n\nCreate a personal access token\nWe must also configure a personal access token or PAT with usethis. Type usethis::create_github_token() in the console. You will either need to log into GitHub or confirm your password. usethis will automatically select some scopes - which ones are selected? We can use these defaults - click the big, green Generate token button at the bottom.\nLeave this page open or copy this and keep it a text file/password manager. We will use it again later. You can even use gitcreds::gitcreds_set() to store your PAT now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also save our PAT in RStudio with: gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\nThis should result in the following message. Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nAdding new credentials…\nRemoving credentials from cache…\nDone.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup the remote GitHub repository\nNow let’s setup a remote repo on GitHub using usethis::use_github. This section is straight out of 17.3 Happy git with R - create and connect a github repo with usethis.\nHow did that go? Did you get an error?\nDon’t worry. We’ve forgotten to do an initial commit a common mistake. Click on the Commit button in the Git pane, select all (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + A) and click Stage. We are going to stage all the files to push to our remote GitHub repo. This might be a bit slow since it is multiple files so be patient. Then, make a commit message in the top right of the window. Click Commit. This creates a record (or anchor in line with the climbing analogy below) in our project that we can view and go back to if we ever need to.\n\nOnce that’s complete, let’s usethis::use_github() in the Console again. How did it go this time?\nHopefully, you see something like this: \nNotice that part of what use_github() does is push the master or main branch to GitHub. (Master is legacy, but you may still see it around.)\nNow go to the link there use_github() set the remote too (in the third line with a ✔️). You will see everything that you’ve commited is now in the online, remote repo! Have a look around. You can navigate, add a README.md file, and even edit files in GitHub.\nLet’s go ahead and edit a file. Go to the ‘Welcome’ post, click on the pencil ✏️ to edit, and make a change. At the bottom you can add a commit message then commit your change.\nCool, but how do we get these changes we made on our remote repo into our local repo on our computer? This is where pull comes in. Back in the RStudio Git pane, you should see a blue down arrow labelled Pull. Click this button. This will update your local repo on your computer with the edit we made in GitHub. Look at your files and see if you can find the change we just made online. Pulling is especially important if you are working on a collaborative project. In general, you want to pull first before pushing to ensure you are working with the most up-to-date version of the project. Even if you are not in a collaborative project, it is a good habit to get into.\nThose are the Git basics! In general, you want to use the following workflow when using git.\n\nMake a change in your files and save. The changes will not show up in the Git pane unless you save the changes.\nStage the files you would like to commit. Can stage multiple files at a time.\nWrite a concise, informative commit message and press the Commit button. If you don’t get any glaringly obvious Error messages, it’s probably all good.\nPull pressing the blue down arrow before pushing with the green up arrow.\nRepeat!"

Such as Quarto Pub and Netlify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQuarto Pub is a free publishing service for quarto content. It requires having a login and an access token. This is a relatively straight forward way to get your blog online. There are some limitations to the size and everything published on Quarto Pub is publicly visible. The link above outlines the steps to publish with Quart Pub. This method does not involve using git.\n\n\nFor this workshop, we will focus on Netlify. In your Netlify account, click on the teal Add new site button.\nImport an existing project from a GitHub repository. You will probably need to configure your Netlify on GitHub. Can either configure all repositories or pick a specific repository.\n\nAuthorize Quarto to access Netlify.\n\nNow that we’ve connected our GitHub to Netlify, go to the Site settings. At the bottom ‘Publish directory’ section put the _site/ folder where your website is rendered.\n\nIt will take a few minutes to deploy your website. Netlify automatically generates a random url like “lighthearted-travesseiro-492jfg3” which can be changed in the ‘Domain settings’. Or course, you can also use/pay for a custom url to remove the ‘netlify.app’ at the end of the url.\nNow, make a change in the welcome post, render the site, commit the changes, and push the changes in the .qmd file. Look at your GitHub remote repo to check that the changes are there. Now check your website - did it update as well?\nAs we defined above, unless you also commited the updated contents of the _site/ foldr the website will not have updated. This folder is where all the rendered outputs are that are used to build the site on Netlify. Commit the updated _site/ folder and push. Now check your website again.\n\n\n\nCheers"

    "text": "This short tutorial will focus on area calculation in R using both vector and raster data. Use the following code to install all necessary packages\ninstall.packages('terra', 'tmap', 'sf', 'tidyverse', 'exactextractr', 'rnaturalearthdata', 'microbenchmark')\nDisclaimer: the author of these notes is by no means an expert on this topic. This is merely a compilation of information I’ve gathered while going down a googling ‘rabbit-hole’. So please get in touch if anything in the notes should be corrected.\n\nArea in 3-dimensions vs. 2-dimensions\nCan I calculate area accurately using a latitude-longitude geographic coordinate reference system (GCS), or should I use a projected coordinate reference system (PCS)?\nGCS’s represent the Earth’s surface in 3-dimensions and have angular, lat-long units (Figure 1). They are defined by a datum (reference points associated with an ellipsoid (a model of the size and shape of the Earth)), a prime meridian, and an angular unit of measure. See here for more detail. Calculating area in a 3-D GCS requires geodesic (i.e., ellipsoidal) computations, which can be complex and computationally expensive.\nPCS’s flatten a GCS into 2-dimensions representing linear units (e.g., metres), helping to make area computations less complex and therefore faster, but also causing some distortion of the Earth’s surface. There are many PCS’s available to use (see here), some of which preserve area (i.e., equal-area projections).\n.\n\nWhich coordinate reference system to use?\nHere we’ll focus on how coordinate reference systems influence area calculations. There is a common misconception that you cannot calculate area accurately when in a lat-long GCS, but this is not true. For example, read the help documentation from the expanse function in {terra}:\n\n?terra::expanse\n\nstarting httpd help server ... done\n\n\n‘For vector data, the best way to compute area is to use the longitude/latitude CRS. This is contrary to (erroneous) popular belief that suggest that you should use a planar coordinate reference system.’\nMore generally however, choosing the best coordinate reference system will depend on the scale and location of your spatial data, and the goal of your analysis. Sometimes you will need to use multiple CRS’s to complete various tasks associated with a single analysis. We won’t dive into the details here, but find a good overview things to consider when choosing a CRS here.\nNote also that it’s always preferable to leave your raster data in it’s native projection if your analysis requires use of values stored in the raster pixels. This is because projecting rasters involves calculating new pixel values via resampling, which results in slight inaccuracies and potential loss of information. There are several methods for resampling depending on they type of data stored in the raster pixels (e.g., categorical vs. continuous), see descriptions here.\n\n\n\nVector area calculations and the new-ish s2 geometry library\nSince 2021, {sf} (versions &gt;1) uses Google’s s2 spherical geometry engine by default when representing vector polygons that are in a lat-long GCS. Previously {sf} would use a planar geometry engine called GEOS, meaning that if you were in a 3-D lat-long GCS, {sf} was assuming flat, planar coordinates. This would result in warning messages like:\nalthough coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar\nNow, when the s2 spherical geometry is on and your data is in a 3-D lat-long GCS, {sf} performs processes and computations on a sphere, rather than in 2-D. The advantages of using the s2 geometry library instead of GEOS are outlined in detail here: r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf7.html. If your data is in a 2-D PCS, {sf} reverts to the planar GEOS geometry engine, assuming flat coordinates (so make sure you’re using a projection that preserves area).\n\nShould I have s2 turned on when calculating area in a geographic CRS?\nWhile the s2 geometry library offers many advantages, when it comes to area there is a speed vs. accuracy trade-off. When s2 is on, {sf} calculates area assuming a spherical approximation of the Earth. But the Earth isn’t a perfect sphere, it’s a spheroid. It bulges at the equator.\nWhen s2 is off, {sf} performs geodesic (i.e., ellipsoidal) area calculations using the high precision GeographicLib that uses a spheroid to represent the Earth’s size and shape. Geodesic calculations will be more accurate than those performed with s2 on, as s2 assumes a spherical representation of the Earth. But geodesic computations more complex, and time costly.\nLet’s examine the speed vs. accuracy trade-off. We’ll start by loading some vector polygons representing countries of the world and check if the geometries are valid.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.0     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.1     ✔ tibble    3.1.8\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.9.3, GDAL 3.5.2, PROJ 8.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\nlibrary(tmap)\noptions(scipen=999)\ntmap_mode('view')\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\nsf_use_s2() # check if s2 is on (it should be as default when sf is loaded)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ndat &lt;- rnaturalearthdata::countries50 %&gt;% # load country polygons for the world\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;% # turn into a simple features dataframe\n  filter(admin == 'Sudan') # filter for a single country\nst_is_valid(dat) # check if geometry is valid\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThe geometry is invalid. Compared to GEOS, s2 has strict polygon conformance that if violated will render invalid geometries. For vector data created in older versions of sf, this can be a bit of a headache. First thing is to try fixing the geometry.\n\ndat_v &lt;- dat %&gt;% st_make_valid()\nst_is_valid(dat_v) # check if geometry is valid\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nqtm(dat_v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt works in this case - the geometry is valid. Now, let’s compare area estimates with s2 on and off.\n\narea_s2 &lt;- st_area(dat_v)/1e6 # area in km2, s2 on by default\nsf_use_s2(FALSE) # turn off s2\n\nSpherical geometry (s2) switched off\n\narea_GeoLib &lt;- st_area(dat_v)/1e6 # area in km2, s2 off, sf calculates geodesic area using GeographicLib\narea_s2 - area_GeoLib # subtract to get the difference in area estimates \n\n6381.861 [m^2]\n\n\nThere is an ~6000 km2 difference in area (note the m2 indicated in the output is incorrect, because we divided by 1e6 to convert m2 to km2). The geodesic calculation using the GeographicLib (i.e, s2 turned off) will be the most accurate estimate because it doesn’t assume the Earth is a perfect sphere. But which is faster? Let’s use {microbenchmark} to find out.\n\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\n\nmicrobenchmark(\n  {sf_use_s2(TRUE); area_s2 &lt;- st_area(dat_v)},\n  {sf_use_s2(FALSE); area_GeoLib &lt;- st_area(dat_v)})\n\nUnit: milliseconds\n                                                       expr     min       lq\n      {     sf_use_s2(TRUE)     area_s2 &lt;- st_area(dat_v) } 12.6714 14.65875\n {     sf_use_s2(FALSE)     area_GeoLib &lt;- st_area(dat_v) } 17.3233 19.41860\n     mean  median      uq     max neval cld\n 15.29274 15.2873 15.9106 20.1017   100  a \n 20.68676 20.3460 21.2224 32.6545   100   b\n\n\nSo computing geodesic area takes more time. In this case it’s only a few milliseconds, so we would turn s2 off and opt for the most accurate, albeit slower, area calculation.\nHow do geodesic area computations using a lat-long GCS compare to an equal-area PCS, like mollweide?\n\ndat_p &lt;- dat_v %&gt;% st_transform('ESRI:54009')\narea_mollweide &lt;- st_area(dat_p)/1e6 # sf uses planar geometry library GEOS\narea_mollweide - (area_GeoLib/1e6)\n\n10556.15 [m^2]\n\n\nThere is an ~ 10000 km2 difference in area estimates, much larger than the difference between area on a sphere (s2 on) and on a spheroid (s2 off, geodesic estimates using GeographicLib).\n\n\nIn summary…\nWhen calculating area of vector polygons in a lat-long GCS using {sf}, it’s best to turn-off s2 and let {sf} calculate area on an ellipsoid (instead of a spherical approximation of the Earth). However, if speed is an issue and you’re not as worried about accuracy, leave s2 on and calculate area using on a sphere.\nIf you’re calculating area in an equal-area PCS using {sf}, it doesn’t matter if s2 is on or off, area will be calculated using GEOS planar geometry engine.\n\n\n\nRaster area calculations\nLike {sf}, if your raster data is in a lat-long GCS, {terra} will compute area in meters squared using geodesic computations based on your spatial data’s ellipsoid with GeographicLib.\nNote that {terra} also has a class for vector data, called ‘SpatVectors’ (raster objects are called ‘SpatRasters’). So we can also calculate area of vector data with {terra}. {sf} should provide the same estimate of area if s2 is turned off, meaning it is using GeographicLib for lat-long GCS computations. Let’s see if this is the case.\nNote: The workflows below are borrowed from here.\nFirst, we’ll create a polygon and a raster.\n\nlibrary(terra)\n\nterra 1.7.18\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'terra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    extract\n\n#| warning: false\nsf_use_s2(TRUE) # make sure s2 is on (we already have sf loaded)\nr &lt;- rast(nrows=10, ncols=10, xmin=0, ymin=0, xmax=10, ymax=10) # make a raster\nr &lt;- init(r, 8) # initialise a spatraster with values\np &lt;- vect('POLYGON ((2 2, 7 6, 4 9, 2 2))', crs = crs(r)) # make a vector polygon\nr_mask &lt;- mask(r, p) # mask the raster to the polygon\nqtm(r) + qtm(r_mask) + qtm(st_as_sf(p))\n\n\n\n\n\nTry toggling the different layers on and off in the interactive map to see what the mask does.\nNote that the raster pixels cover a larger area than the polygon. By default ‘mask’ includes all raster pixels that the polygon touches. We could use the disagg function to reduce the resolution and better match the area of the raster to the area of the polygon (but we won’t do that here).\nNow let’s compare area estimates with {terra} and {sf}.\n\narea_t &lt;- expanse(p, unit = 'km') # here 'terra' is computing geodesic area (i.e., based on a spheroid, not planar)\nsf_use_s2(FALSE) # turn off s2 to uses the GeographicLig\n\nSpherical geometry (s2) switched off\n\narea_sf &lt;- st_area(st_as_sf(p))/1e6 # here 'sf' using GEOS to calculate area\nround(area_t - as.numeric(area_sf))\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nGreat, so as we expect, no difference in area estimates between {terra} and {sf} when s2 geometry library is turned off.\n\nCompute area of raster data using {terra}\nLet’s use {terra} to compute the area of a raster that intersects with a vector polygon. We’ll use the functions cellSize and mask from {terra}.\n\nr_area &lt;- cellSize(r_mask, unit=\"km\") # create a raster where pixel values are area in km2\nqtm(r_area) + qtm(st_as_sf(p)) # have a quick look\n\n\n\n\ne &lt;- extract(r_area, p, exact=TRUE) # extract pixel values that intersect with vector polygon, and get fraction of each cell that is covered\narea_t - sum(e$area * e$fraction) # calculate difference between area of the vector polygon, and the estimate of area of the 'raster'\n\n[1] 165.0552\n\n\nThere is a 165 km2 difference in area calculated using a raster vs. vector polygon.\n\n\nCompute area of raster data using {exactextractr}\n{exactextractr} can be used to perform raster computations within vector polygon areas very quickly, and it can do similar things as {terra}’s extract function that we used above. However, it uses a spherical approximation of the Earth, rather than a spheroid. Let’s compare estimates of area between {terra} and {exactextractr}.\n\nlibrary(exactextractr)\n\ne2 &lt;- exact_extract(r_area, st_as_sf(p))[[1]]\nsum(e$area * e$fraction) - sum(e2$value * e2$coverage_fraction)\n\n[1] 18.47752\n\n\nThe difference in area is very minor, ~18 km2. Which is faster?\n\nmicrobenchmark(extract(r_area, p, exact=TRUE), \n               exact_extract(r_area, st_as_sf(p)))\n\nUnit: milliseconds\n                               expr       min        lq     mean    median\n   extract(r_area, p, exact = TRUE)  3.849801  4.482651  5.85123  4.683601\n exact_extract(r_area, st_as_sf(p)) 22.067002 25.155950 28.42134 25.769050\n       uq      max neval cld\n  5.01555  96.5561   100  a \n 28.03330 220.6204   100   b\n\n\n{terra} wins! So in this case there is no speed vs. accuracy trade-off. {terra} is faster and more accurate, because it is not assuming that the Earth is a sphere to make area calculations.\n\n\nComparing PCS area computations between {terra} and {sf}\nDo estimates of vector polygon area differ between {terra} and {sf} when in an equal-area PCS, like mollweide?\n\narea_t_mollweide &lt;- expanse(vect(dat_p), 'km', transform = F)\nround(as.numeric(area_mollweide) - area_t_mollweide)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nNo difference.\n\n\nIn summary…\nIf using a lat-long GCS to calculate area in R, {terra} and {sf} will provide the same estimates for vector polygons, as long as s2 is turned off. For raster areas in polygons, {terra} is faster and more accurate than {exactextractr}."

    "text": "Petition to increase Australian PhD Stipends\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease consider signing this e-petition to increase PhD stipends to minimum wage. Petition reason from the online petition is copied below.\nPetition Reason\nPhD students contribute enormously to Australia’s research every year, with their time accounting for 56% the total research output. They are the future professors and industry professionals of this country, responsible for driving innovation and ensuring strong international collaborations and competition. Their contribution is often rewarded with a stipend intended to cover the cost of living, with a minimum rate set by the Australian government. Currently, this scholarship rate is $29,863 per year for PhD students to live on while usually working more than 40 hrs per week on their research. Not only is this below minimum wage, but it is even forcing students to live below the poverty line. With this treatment, students are incentivised to accept positions abroad, reject higher degrees by research, or quit midway through their degree due to financial distress. Australia is actively discouraging higher education and slowing its economic growth and productivity by underpaying PhD students. We believe the government should support higher education and ensure a competitive standing for Australia. The way to do this is by setting a fair, liveable rate for PhD scholarships, which is at least equivalent to the minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will have a combined session for our March workshop.

    "text": "Petition to increase Australian PhD Stipends\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease consider signing this e-petition to increase PhD stipends to minimum wage. Petition reason from the online petition is copied below.\nPetition Reason\nPhD students contribute enormously to Australia’s research every year, with their time accounting for 56% the total research output. They are the future professors and industry professionals of this country, responsible for driving innovation and ensuring strong international collaborations and competition. Their contribution is often rewarded with a stipend intended to cover the cost of living, with a minimum rate set by the Australian government. Currently, this scholarship rate is $29,863 per year for PhD students to live on while usually working more than 40 hrs per week on their research. Not only is this below minimum wage, but it is even forcing students to live below the poverty line. With this treatment, students are incentivised to accept positions abroad, reject higher degrees by research, or quit midway through their degree due to financial distress. Australia is actively discouraging higher education and slowing its economic growth and productivity by underpaying PhD students. We believe the government should support higher education and ensure a competitive standing for Australia. The way to do this is by setting a fair, liveable rate for PhD scholarships, which is at least equivalent to the minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tony Howes (UQ, School of Chemical Engineering) will be sharing how Python and Folium (a wrapper for Python of the JavaScript Leaflet library) work together to create an interactive map. The data will be from the Brisbane Dawn Nav, May 5th MapRun. Workshop materials will be in a Jupyter notebook and downloading Anaconda is recommended if you wish to follow along.\n\n\n\n\nIn April, Dr Jacinta Holloway-Brown presented a very informative and interesting workshop that outlined her use of Stochastic spatial random forest SS-RF methods for filling missing data in satellite images due to clouds, and also went over using raster2data for working with spatial image files (such as rasters), and converting these to dataframes in R in order to perform statistical analyses. Expect the blog post and recording associated with this workshop to be available shortly."

Please check out the new site, and let Nick (n.wiggins at library dot uq dot edu dot au), who has been leading the switch, know if you find any issues. We also expect to move to a new domain shortly that reflects our new name.\nWhich brings me to….\n\n\nSurvey results\nThanks to everyone who took to time to fill out our survey. Here are a few of the main results.\n\nWho are we?\n\n\n\nWhat should we be called?\nWe put it to the group to vote on a new name, mainly because a lot of our members are not affiliated with UQ – so UQ geospatial didn’t seem appropriate anymore. The most popular result was Geospatial Community, so we will stick with that.\n\n\nMission statement\nFrom the survey results and some discussion among the organising committee, we also drafted a mission statement:\n“Our mission is to build a supportive and inclusive community where students and professionals can grow their geospatial skills together.”\nI hope this captures what the group is all about; please get in touch to suggested changes.\n\n\nWhat people want to learn about?\nThere were some really interesting and topical suggestions for future workshops:\n\nHow to handle big spatial data on the HPC – learn the basics of transferring data and scripts to the HPC, writing a bash shell script to submit a batch job to the HPC, and parallel processing to speed things up\nPros and Cons of different GIS software, e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS, R, python, etc\nWhat is GDAL and why is it important for spatial data scientists to know about?\nHow to model spatial data and deal with spatial autocorrelation\nRemote-sensing image analysis using machine learning We will do our best to find presenters to deliver workshops around these themes.\n\n\n\n\nOrganising committe\nHuge thanks to\n\nChristina Buelow\nCatherine Kim\nNick Wiggins\nMitchel Rudge\nTanya Dodgen\nAnnie Nguyen\nJason Dail\nKaiching Cheong\n\nfor volunteering to help out on the organising committee. Excited for the year ahead 😊"
