This repository is used to create the [Geospatial Community website and blog](https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/).

To make our events enjoyable, safe and welcoming, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/geocommunity/geocommunity_blog/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md)

## Adding to and editing the Monthly Newsletter
The next month's newsletter draft can be found in that month's folder in the [_templates folder on GitHub](https://github.com/geocommunity/geocommunity_blog/tree/main/_templates). <br>
If you have a GitHub account, you can go to the .qmd file for that month, click the edit pencil ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67612228/232414718-fe2829d2-dfd4-4f47-9afb-bea02bdfc1c9.png) in the top right, and you can then add text to the Newsletter. <br>
If you are unsure how to format your text (adding bold, italics, titles, links, etc), [this is a very useful guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
 

If there isn't a folder for the next month, you can contact an admin, or create folder yourself with the naming format YYYY-MM-DD-newsletter-very-brief-description and then copy in the newsletter template qmd file.

You can find the template for the [Newsletter here](https://github.com/geocommunity/geocommunity_blog/blob/main/_templates/newsletter.qmd).

## Questions about using GitHub
You can find a [guide here](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training/blob/master/Git/GitHub/GitHub_intro.md) for interacting with and using GitHub.
You can ask [Nicholas Wiggins](https://github.com/Nijawi) from the University of Queensland Library for futher support with this page.
